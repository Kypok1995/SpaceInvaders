# SpaceInvaders
Repository for Space Invaders arcade game I made during Tech Academy bootcamp Live Project.

## Invaders Screens
First thing I did for this game was creating a basic set of scenes: menu, gameplay and restart scenes. Transition between scenes is smooth because of prefab of SceneLoader, provided by Tech Academy instructors.

##Player movement
Player is controlled by arrow keys or WASD. Game allows player to move on X and Y axis. Movement implemented using the Unity physics engine. In order to recreate weightlessness, the player is constantly affected by a lifting force that neutralizes gravity
